       * When I say "tantumPlurale", it means words which can refer to only one thing.

       * So "drwi" is "tantumPlurale", because it can mean "door" as well as "doors".
       * But "ludzie" is NOT a "tantumPlurale", because it can't mean "person", it only means "people".

       * So "ludzie" is just a "lacking" lObj, ie it is missing its singular inflections,
       * while "drwi" is both "lacking" and "tantumPlurale".
